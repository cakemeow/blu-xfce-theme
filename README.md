# Everblushing Xfce

## Note
Dotfiles are kind-a finished, although I haven't tested anything yet. The eww sidebar is made for 1366x768 screen, so you will have to adjust the sidebar yourself if you're using a bigger, or worse, a smaller display.

## Installation
Assuming that you're familiar with how Xfce works and stores its configuration files, installing these config files of Xfce should be easy for you. And if you're not, then I'd suggest you not to use my dotfiles. Currently, I'm either too lazy or too tired or too busy to write the whole freaking 69420 lines of installation tutorial.

## Sneak peek

### Stuff stuffs
* <b>OS:</b> btw<br>
Although it doesn't matter, but the upgradable package count seen in the eww sidebar relies on `pacman`, which is the package manager of Arch and derivatives.
* <b>DE:</b> Xfce 4.16
* <b>Colorscheme:</b> [Everblush](https://github.com/Everblush)
* <b>WM:</b> Xfwm<br>
Yeah, actually, many of the stuffs (most) used on my rice are of Xfce DE, including the notification daemon (xfce4-notifyd), panel (xfce4-panel), file manager (thunar) etc.
* <b>Compositor:</b> picom-git
* <b>Sidebar:</b> eww
* <b>Terminal Emulator:</b> Kitty, with `zsh` and `spaceship-prompt`
* <b>Application Launcher:</b> [Findex](https://github.com/mdgaziur/findex)
* <b>gtk3-classic</b> instead of gtk3, because I love xfwm decorations more than CSD

### Theme stuffs
* <b>Gtk-theme, xfwm-theme, kvantum theme:</b> all of them are handmade<br>
I know that there already exists a gtk theme following the Everblush color palette, but I find it hard to use on Xfce.
* A super bloat <b>gtk.css</b> for beauty
* <b>Icon theme:</b> A mashup of Zafiro icons (main), Numix apps (fallback) and Fluent-icons (panel)
* <b>Font:</b> Roboto for interface, JetBrainsMono (Nerd) for monospace
* <b>Cursor:</b> Qogir

### More stuffs
* Config for <b>cava</b>
* Config for <b>Neofetch</b> and <b>Fastfetch</b>
* Config for <b>bat</b>
* <b>Zsh</b> config (spaceship-prompt required)
* Some <b>genmon scripts</b> for xfce-panel
* And probably some more, idk I don't remember

## (Possible) FAQ

### Installation tutorial when?
Idk for now

### Are the dots finally complete?
No haha. It shouldn't take a lot time tho.

## Future plans
* Add some wallpapers to blend in with the overall theme
* Add a lockscreen
