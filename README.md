# Everblush (WIP)
A (probably) nicely themed xfce desktop for those who are never satisfied with their desktops like me.

**Note that everything here is more or less work-in-progress and stuffs may or may not change in future without any prior notice. I won't be reachable before August, 2022 because of an important exam I have. However, please report issues if you find any**
