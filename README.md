~~I'll write documentations for real, no matter how long it takes.~~ I won't. Sorry.

- **Distro:** That weird distro with an A in its logo. Distro doesn't matter for this rice, hopefully
- **Desktop Environment:** Xfce 4.18, obviously
- **Window Manager:** Xfwm4, again, obviously
- **Compositor:** Picom ([this](https://github.com/fdev31/picom/tree/animation-pr) fork by [fdev31](https://github.com/fdev31))
- **Panel:** Xfce4-panel
- **File Manager:** Thunar
- **App Launcher:** [Findex](https://github.com/mdgaziur/findex) (You can also find a rofi config here, I use rofi for rofi-emoji)
- **Widgets:** [Elkowars wacky widgets](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) (User dashboard and system resource monitor)
- **i3lock-color** script as lockscreen
- **Skippy-XD:** Skippy-XD is similar to the expose-thing from MacOS
- ~~Can't remember~~ And more!

## What do we have in this repo? (For now)

### Theme related stuff
- **Colorscheme**: Tokyonight (Night variant)
- **GTK theme:** [Lavanda](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Lavanda-gtk-theme), but with Tokyonight color palette. Supports GTK 3 and 4, but not libadwaita. I'm aware about an existing tokyonight gtk theme, but I don't like it, at least not for Xfce
- **Kvantum theme:** [Lavanda](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Lavanda-kde/tree/main/Kvantum), but with Tokyonight colorscheme applied.
- **Xfwm theme:** Made in figma. I like to call it "cirkle"
- **Icon theme:** A modified Zafiro icon theme (with Tokyonight colored folders and symbolic icons), Fluent, and I don't actually even remember
- **Cursor theme:** [Volantes Cursors](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1356095/)

### Config files
- **bat** config (a better `cat`)
- **gtk3.css** config
- **gtk4.css** config for obvious stuffs
- **Picom** config **_WITH ANIMATIONS ON XFCE_**
- **Neofetch** config
- **Skippy-XD:** Skippy-XD is similar to the expose-thing from MacOS. I use this cause the regular alt-tab is so boring
- **~/.Xresources** config
- **Rofi** config, although I use it for rofi-emoji. I use Findex as application launcher
- **Onboard** tokyonight theme. For real???
- **i3lock-color** lock screen script
- And some misc stuffs ~~I don't remember about~~

### Readme is to be changed soon, to make more sense
